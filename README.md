# üìî Applied Machine Learning Fundamentals (Lecture) ü§ñ

```
'We are drowning in information and starving for knowledge.' ‚Äì John Naisbitt
```

Machine learning / data science is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience
**without being explicitly programmed**. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs which can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
A machine learning algorithm learns by building a mathematical / statistical model from the data. This model can then be used for inference and decision making. 
Machine learning has become an integral part of many modern applications. It is a cross-topic discipline which comprises computer science, math / statistics as well as
domain and business knowledge:

A list of abbreviations, symbols and mathematical notation used in the context of the slides can be found [here](https://github.com/DaWe1992/Applied_ML_Fundamentals/blob/master/01_slides/symbols.pdf).
Please find additional material below.

## Assignments ‚úíÔ∏è
The assignments are voluntary. All students who choose to participate have to form groups comprising three to four students (not more and not less).
The groups do not have to be static, you may form new groups for each assignment.
The task descriptions, starter code and data sets for the assignments can be found in the folder [02_exercises](https://github.com/DaWe1992/Applied_ML_Fundamentals/tree/master/02_exercises).
You have two weeks to answer the questions and to submit your work. The solutions are going to be presented and discussed after the submission deadline.
Sample solutions will **not** be uploaded. However, you are free to share correct solutions with your colleagues **after they have been graded**.

**Formal requirements for submissions:**
* Please submit your solutions via Moodle (as a *.zip* file) as well as in printed form. The *.zip* file must contain one *.pdf* file for the pen-and-paper tasks as well as one *.py* file per programming task.
Only pen-and-paper tasks have to be printed, you do not have to print the source code.
* Only one member of the group has to submit the solutions. Please make sure to specify the matriculation numbers (not the names!) of all group members so that all participants receive the points they deserve!
* Please refrain from submitting hand-written solutions or images of solutions (*.png* / *.jpg* files). Rather use proper type-setting software like LaTeX or other comparable programs.
If you choose to use LaTeX, you may want to use the template files located [here](https://github.com/DaWe1992/Applied_ML_Fundamentals/tree/master/03_tex_files/02_exercises) for your answers.
* Code assignments have to be done in Python. Please submit *.py* files (no jupyter notebooks).
* The following packages are allowed for code submissions: *numpy*, *pandas* and *scipy*. Please ask **beforehand**, if you want to use a specific package not mentioned here.
* Do not use already implemented models (e.g. from *scikit-learn*).

> **Please make sure to fulfill the above mentioned formal requirements. Otherwise, you may risk to lose points. Submissions which severely violate the specifications might not get any points at all!**

**Grading details for assignments**

Your homework is going to be corrected and given back to you. Correct solutions are rewarded with a bonus for the exam which amounts to at most ten percent of the exam,
if all solutions submitted by you are correct (this corresponds to at most six points in the exam). It is still possible to achieve full points in the exam, even if you choose not to participate in the assignments (it is additional).
Below you find the [function](https://github.com/DaWe1992/Applied_ML_Fundamentals/blob/master/03_tex_files/03_img/bonus_point_function.png) which is used to compute the bonus as well as a legend which explains what the components mean.
Please note that this is not a linear function.

</p>

| Parameter 													                        			|	Explanation										|	Value 		|
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b" width=15px height=15px>		|	bonus points attained for the exam				| 	up to you	|
| <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=B" width=15px height=15px>		|	maximum attainable bonus points for the exam	|	6			|
| <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=A" width=15px height=15px>		|	maximum attainable points in the assignments	|	40 			|
| <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=a" width=15px height=15px>		|	score achieved in the assignments				|	up to you	|

**Please note:** The bonus points will be taken into account in case you have to repeat the exam (i.e. they do not expire if you fail the first attempt).
üö© **Very important:** üö© Unsurprisingly, the solutions have to be your own work. **If you plagiarize in the assignments, you will lose all bonus points!**

## Exam üìù
The exam is going to take 60 minutes. The maximum attainable score will be 60 points, so you have one minute per point.
**Important:** Keep your answers short and simple in order not to lose too much valuable time.
The exam questions will be given in English, but you may answer them in either English or German (you are also allowed to mix the languages).
Please do not translate domain specific technical terms in order to avoid confusion. Please answer all questions on the task sheets (you may also write on the back-sides).

**Exam preparation:**
* You will not be asked for any derivations, rather I want to test whether you understand the general concepts.
* The exam will contain a mix of multiple choice questions, short answer questions and calculations.
* Make sure you can answer the self-test questions provided for each topic. **There won't be sample solutions for those questions!** (This would undermine the sense of **self**-test questions).
* Some of the slides give you important hints (upper left corner):
	*  A slide marked with symbol (1) provides in-depth information which you do not have to know by heart (think of it as additional material for the sake of completeness).
	*  Symbol (2) indicates very important content. Make sure you understand it!
* Make sure you understand the homework assignments.
* Work through the [list of 150+ terms](https://github.com/DaWe1992/Applied_ML_Fundamentals/blob/master/04_exam/terms_you_have_to_know.pdf) which you should be able to explain.
* One exemplary exam is provided. You can find it in the folder [04_exam](https://github.com/DaWe1992/Applied_ML_Fundamentals/tree/master/04_exam). The solutions will be discussed in the last session of the lecture.

**Auxiliary material for the exam:**
* Non-programmable pocket calculator
* Two-sided **hand-written** cheat sheet (you may note whatever you want)

**Exam grading**

Since the lecture *Applied Machine Learning Fundamentals* is part of a bigger module (*Machine Learning Fundamentals, W3WI_DS304)*, it is not graded individually.
Instead, the score you achieved in the exam (at most 60 points) will be added to the points you receive in the second element of the module, the *Data Exploration Project* in the 4th semester (cf. below)
which is also worth 60 points at maximum. Your performance in both elements combined will determine the eventual grade.
**Please note:** Even with bonus points included, it is not possible to get more than 60 points for the exam.

Please refer to the official [DHBW data science module catalogue](https://www.dhbw.de/fileadmin/user/public/SP/MA/Wirtschaftsinformatik/Data_Science.pdf) for further details.

## Python Code üêç
Machine learning algorithms (probably all algorithms) are easier to understand, if you see them implemented. Please find Python implementations for some of the algorithms (which are not part of the assignments) in the folder
[06_python](https://github.com/DaWe1992/Applied_ML_Fundamentals/tree/master/06_python).
Play around with the hyper-parameters of the algorithms and try different data sets in order to get a better feeling for how the algorithms work. Also, debug through the code line for line and check what each line does.

In general, the [Coursera machine learning course](https://de.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning#about) by Andrew Ng is highly recommended.
You can get a nice certificate if you want (around $60), but you can also participate in the course for free (without getting the certificate):
