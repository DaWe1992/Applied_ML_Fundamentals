## Weekly Assignments
We will provide starter code and task descriptions for the weekly assignments in this repository (folder [exercises](https://github.com/DaWe1992/Applied_ML_Fundamentals/tree/master/exercises)). Solutions will be presented and discussed in the next class. The assignments must be handed in via Moodle, questions can be asked via the Moodle forum.

## Literature
You do not need to buy any book and we will provide links to more resources (e.g. relevant papers) in class.
We recommend the book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop ([link](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387310732)), which covers most of the topics discussed in class very well. For the refresher on linear algebra/statistics/optimization and for deep learning we recommend the book "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville (free access [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)).
