## Weekly Assignments
We will provide starter code and task descriptions for the weekly assignments in this repository (folder [exercises](https://github.com/DaWe1992/Applied_ML_Fundamentals/tree/master/exercises)). Solutions will be presented and discussed in the next class. The assignments must be handed in via Moodle, questions can be asked via the Moodle forum.
