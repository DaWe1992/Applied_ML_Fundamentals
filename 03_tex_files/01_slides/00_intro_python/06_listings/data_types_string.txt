# this declares a variable s initialized with value "Hello"
s = 'Hello'

# you may also use double quotes
s = "Hello"

# indexing is possible (starts at 0)
s = "Hello"[1] # gives "e"

# indexing from the back
s = "Hello"[-1] # gives "o"

# dynamic typing: now you can use the same variable to save numbers;
# keep track of what you do with your variables!
