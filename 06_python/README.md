## How to run the Code
Please see the file `main.py` to execute the code for the algorithms. The file contains functions for
classification, regression, reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning. Simply uncomment the parts which you want to use.

Also, this repository contains classes for data creation, evaluation and plotting.
Please refer to the folder [utils](https://github.com/DaWe1992/Applied_ML_Fundamentals/tree/master/06_python/utils).
 
## Which algorithms are included?

	* Multi-layer perceptron
	* Support vector machine
2. **Regression**
	* Bayesian linear regression
	* Gaussian process regression
	* Kernel (ridge) regression
	* k-nearest neighbors regression
	* Support vector regression
3. **Reinforcement learning**
	* Policy iteration
	* Q-learning
	* Value iteration
4. **Unsupervised learning**
