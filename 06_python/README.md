# Python Code üêç
Machine learning algorithms (probably all algorithms) are easier to understand, if you see them implemented. Here you find Python implementations for some of the algorithms (which are not part of the assignments).
Play around with the hyper-parameters of the algorithms and try different data sets in order to get a better feeling for how the algorithms work. Also, debug through the code line for line and check what each line does.

## How to run the Code?
Please use the script located in `main.py` to execute the code for the algorithms. The file contains functions for
classification, regression, reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning. Simply uncomment the parts which you want to use. Also, this repository contains classes for data creation, evaluation and plotting.
Please refer to the folder [utils](https://github.com/DaWe1992/Applied_ML_Fundamentals/tree/master/06_python/utils) for this.
 
## Which Algorithms are included?
The following algorithms are implemented (some are missing, since they are part of the exercises):
